# Singleton design
    - Only create ONE instance for project
    - used in logger, session sql, etc,...


# Factory method design
    - when we want to flexible createing object. (Ex: Create object from string param)
    - Objects are created without exposing the logic to client.

# Decorator design
    - Actually this is passing function as arguments. We have wrapped function, it is outside of main function
    - Modify behaviour of function without change main function


# Adapter design
    - is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible 
    - Example: metiz.vn has adapter to get data from cinema systems
